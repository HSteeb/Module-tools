u2o.py vs. usfm2osis.py notes:

\qa (acrostic) has major bug which moves punctation!
Mishandles \q1 (blank <line>) before new verse
Needs to move pre-verse titles, references, etc into verse
Canonical titles are not handled correctly (see above about pre-verse titles)
Some verses are not well formed in ISA, PRO, and PSA (found by osis2mod, but validates)
\cl doesn't work right (TKL)
Uses u"" strings which are not allowed in Python3
Bug on line 494: r"\ie\n"
\w glossary\w* handled as index (incorrect and does not validate either)
Attribute type="psalm" should be reserved only for Psalms

Speed:
TKL with usfm2osis.py: 83s
TKL with u2o.py: < 4s
TKL with u2o.py (orig): < 2s

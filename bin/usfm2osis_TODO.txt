TODO for usfm2osis.py:
Allow specified elements to be commented out (Intro title, chapter name, <p type="x-noindent">, footnote references)
Allow certain heading types to be mapped? (Intro Gen)
DONE: Move inter-verse <p> and </p> forward or backward to be inside adjacent verse tags.
DONE: Stop removing <lb/> between line groups.

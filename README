This is a template for a usfm -> module conversion repo.

The directories are 

usfm - initial import of usfm files into here, please. All usfm2osis work
should happen in this directory. 

osis - Once a working and clean osis file has been produced it can be stored
in here. 

bin - for Makefiles, scripts and other executables which are specific for
this module. 

module - for module output. 

Please copy this template into your chosen location and do
git init
git add * 
git commit *

This will set up a git repo for your module project

Now obtain the USFM files, and unzip them into the usfm directory. More
instructions there

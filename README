This is a template for a usfm -> module conversion repo.

The directories are 

usfm - initial import of usfm files into here, please. All usfm2osis work
should happen in this directory. 

bin - for Makefiles, scripts and other executables which are specific for
this module. 

There are currently two versions for makefiles - one for USFM and one for
thos occasions when someone publishes a OSIS file as source. 

Please copy this template into your chosen location and do
git init
git add * 
git commit *

This will set up a git repo for your module project

Now choose your makefile, copy it into "makefile" and run "make setup". 

Now obtain the USFM files, and unzip them into the usfm directory. More
instructions there
